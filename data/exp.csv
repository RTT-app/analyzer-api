> Researchers with the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and University of Florida, who viewed Ladapo&#039;s edits on the study and have followed the issue closely, criticized the surgeon general for making the changes.

> Ladapo was picked by DeSantis in September 2021 to become the state&#039;s surgeon general as DeSantis waged war against President Joe Biden&#039;s Covid-related restrictions and ordered the state to ban mask-wearing requirements in schools and employer-issued vaccine mandates.

> The complaint, which the Florida Department of Health&#039;s inspector general investigated, accused Ladapo of &quot;Scientific fraud&quot; for allegedly manipulating the final draft of the study.

Justice Clarence Thomas said he was advised he didn‚Äôt have to disclose private jet flights and luxury vacations paid for by billionaire Harlan Crow because, although a close friend, Crow ‚Äúdid not have business before the court.‚Äù 

But in at least one case, Crow did.

Bloomberg reviewed dozens of state and federal cases involving companies that the Crow family has owned or had a financial stake in since Thomas‚Äô 1991 confirmation. Nearly all of these disputes played out at the trial and appellate level and didn‚Äôt reach the Supreme Court.

In January 2005, though, the court declined to hear an appeal from an architecture firm that wanted more than $25 million from Trammell Crow Residential Co. for allegedly misusing copyrighted building designs. When the court issued a one-sentence order denying the petition, there were no noted recusals ‚Äî indicating that Thomas participated ‚Äî and no noted dissents. 

The Crow family had a non-controlling interest in the company at the time, according to a statement to Bloomberg from Harlan Crow‚Äôs office. Thomas had already reported a 1997 private flight and high-dollar gifts from Crow, both documented in a December 2004 report from the Los Angeles Times. The justice had described Crow and his wife Kathy as ‚Äúpersonal friends.‚Äù

While the current state of the country may seem grim, we have to operate under the belief that corrupt officials will ultimately be held accountable for their actions, even if it takes longer than we'd prefer. The alternative is to lay down and let the corruption wash over us.

Yes, much like with Trump, even if the House voted to impeach, it's unlikely that Thomas would face any actual consequences given the current makeup of the Senate. That being said, as we continue to fight back against corruption and the conservative push for a more fascistic style of governance, we move the dial ever so slightly each time. Think back to when certain antics that became normalized over the course of Trump's presidency. He, along with his followers and a spineless GOP that sought power over all else, pushed the dial in the wrong direction. It's not unfixable, unless we are complacent and apathetic. 

Little by little, it is our responsibility as citizens to keep pushing that dial back the other direction, towards accountability for our elected representatives, towards rational and fact-based discourse, towards no longer empowering or emboldening the worst among us. Please for everyone's sake, don't give up.",1

In a better timeline, Thomas would have already been shamed out of office and be awaiting trial for corruption in public office or something.  On top of owing the taxpayers the value of everything he was paid/gifted/etc in order to secure the benefits of his office.

Of course, we live in the worst timeline, so he'll stay the course, be lauded by his peers, take some nice vacations and weigh in on a few more rulings undermining the nation's stability for decades to come.",1

691,Ron DeSantis Short Circuits When Asked About Dropping Poll Numbers: The Florida governor is a walking meme.,,"Floridian here, so obviously I've been paying attention to ol' Ronnie for a while now. What I'm not seeing mentioned is something more subtle ‚Äî¬†he's using a ""dual track"" strategy. Yeah, he wants to be the nominee and all that. But his fall-back plan is forcing Trump (or whoever the nominee ends up being) to pick him as VP.

A certain number of Floridians will vote for him because they want someone from the ""home team"" in the Executive branch. Florida is the third most populous state in the nation, with 30 electoral votes. It is fairly difficult to win the Presidency without Florida. The redistricting and gerrymandering don't impact Presidential elections very much.

The 2020 vote was 51% to 48% in favor of Trump. If Ron took even 10% of the Republican vote (let's call that 5% of the total vote) that shifts to 48 / 46 / 5 ‚Äî¬†and the Republicans don't like that math. As Governor of that state, Ron also has significant influence on the matters of choosing electors ‚Äî¬†which could be a very important issue again in 2024, perhaps critical to the outcome.

Being pretty young, and knowing Trump would be term limited to four years no matter what, being VP would set him up pretty well for a 2028 run. He'd view the position as a necessary stepping stone into national politics and a way to make good connections which will help him in the future.

Plus if by some crazy circumstances the country comes to its senses after electing that pair and Trump got removed or forced to resign, as the VP Ron would obviously be left in charge with relatively clean hands. He could even hold a pardon over Trump's head to help things go whatever direction he wants.

Ron sees a bunch of ways to win long-term. He's got a big ego so he's keeping his eye on the prize, but he's also pragmatic enough to evaluate ALL his options.",1

>You can see a hint of this problem in the viral video from 2019 that captures Feinstein lecturing young protesters from the Sunrise Movement, a climate-activist group, who occupied her office, hoping to hector her into supporting the Green New Deal.

>And because American politics are so volatile, experienced officials may never feel like the time is right to yield power. There‚Äôs always one more threat to democracy to stave off, one more international crisis to avert. Rather than entertaining plans to retire, older politicians come to regard staying in office as a patriotic duty. Gradually, gerontocracy can become a self-protective cartel, where the tricks of the trade are deployed for the sole purpose of remaining in the club.

>The Senate does a terrible job of regulating itself in this regard. With so many years between elections‚Äîand much advantage to incumbency‚Äîdesks on the Senate floor easily become tenured. And every Senator has an interest in protecting the system of tenure, in the hopes of receiving every collegial benefit of the doubt when they face their own hardship that might interfere with their job performance.

Aside from the obvious issue of staying in a position long past the time that one is able to effectively perform the work that is required, one of the other key reminders here is that representation and diversity is critical. It's not just gender or ethnicity that needs to be represented but many other factors as well, including age.

However, fundamentally, this is about a generation of leaders at the end of the careers in public service being unwilling to hand over the reigns of power. Pelosi is the rare exception in handing the House to Jeffries. We'll see what Schumer does with the Senate, and Biden with the Presidency.

So I was not surprised when he, too, turned the conversation to the debt ceiling, barely containing his glee at our self-inflicted wound.

...

> Today the competition between democracies and autocracies has grown more intense. And by undermining America‚Äôs credibility and the pre-eminence of the dollar, the fight over the debt ceiling plays right into the hands of Xi Jinping of China and Vladimir Putin of Russia.
...

> Trust matters in international affairs. We frequently ask other nations to put their faith in the United States. Our military will be there to protect allies, our financial system is secure, and when we warn about compromised Chinese telecom equipment or an impending Russian invasion, we‚Äôre telling the truth. Threatening to break America‚Äôs promise to pay our debts calls all that into question.

...

> Today America‚Äôs credibility will help determine whether nervous Europeans continue to stand with us and support Ukraine or seek an accommodation with an emboldened Russia. It could determine whether more Asian nations welcome American military bases and troops to deter Chinese aggression, as the Philippines recently did, or buckle to Beijing‚Äôs bullying.

> There‚Äôs more. Playing games with the debt ceiling imperils the dollar‚Äôs pre-eminent position in the global economy and the power that gives the United States.

Just a reminder that ""late term abortion"" only happens when there's a medical emergency involved. Most likely when the fetus is dead/has zero chance of surviving and the woman's life is in danger if she continues the pregnancy. These usually involve women who wanted the baby and are distraught that they need to choose between abortion or risking their lives to give birth to a dead baby.

Nobody is carrying the pregnancy to 8.5 months and then deciding ""nah, I don't want this kid so I'll get an abortion.""

Attempts to ban late term abortions are both a foot in the door to ban all abortions (they move the ban date further and further until all abortions are banned) and are a way of putting women's lives at risk. All without any ""baby lives saved.""

The decision to have an abortion should involve only the woman and her doctor. Women who need late term abortions deserve sympathy and support, not demonization and bans.",1

In a full-term pregnancy, there is either a natural delivery, a delivery facilitated by oxytocin (which increases contractions), or a C-section. NOT an ""abortion""!!!",1
1072,Watch Lindsey Graham Absolutely Lose His Shit Over Abortion,,"**From Carter Sherman:**

South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham used to say that abortion is a state's rights issue. That is, until the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last year‚Äîand Graham started pushing for a federal ban after 15 weeks of pregnancy.

But when CNN asked him about whether abortion is a federal issue on Sunday, he lost it.

‚ÄúWhat the Democratic Party proposes on abortion is barbaric,‚Äù Graham told CNN‚Äôs Dana Bash just days after the Supreme Court ruled to keep a safe and effective abortion pill on the market. ‚ÄúAbortion up to the moment of birth, taxpayer-funded‚ÄîI think is barbaric.""

Graham‚Äôs characterization of Democrats‚Äô position on abortion is misleading. Most states, including ones governed by Democrats, have limits on abortions before or at viability, which generally occurs at around 24 weeks of pregnancy.

Also, anyone who knows anything about pregnancy or basic female anatomy knows that no mother-to-be changes their mind about delivering a viable baby just for the hell of it. Graham has no clue what it takes to birth a baby or raise a child. Push a grape through your urethra, Lindsey, and when it's 'crowning' to the point that I can tell if it's red or green, let me know if you'd like to abort or deliver it.

[It was the raid and destruction of Germany's sex research institute](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institut_f%C3%BCr_Sexualwissenschaft):

>On 6 May 1933, while Hirschfeld was in¬†Ascona, Switzerland, the¬†Deutsche Studentenschaft¬†made an organised attack on the Institute of Sex Research. A¬†brass band¬†accompanied them as they arrived in the morning. After breaking into the building, the students destroyed much of what was inside, and looted tens of thousands of items ‚Äî including works by¬†authors who had been blacklisted in Nazi Germany. Following this, the leader of the students gave a speech before the institute, and the students sang¬†Horst-Wessel-Lied.¬†***It is presumed that¬†Dora ""D√∂rchen"" Richter¬†(the first known person to undergo complete male-to-female sex reassignment surgery) may have been killed in this or a subsequent attack on the institute.*** Members of the¬†Sturmabteilung¬†(SA) appeared later in the day to continue looting the institute.

>Four days later, the institute's remaining library and archives were publicly hauled out and¬†burned¬†in the streets of the¬†Opernplatz¬†by members of SA alongside the students. A bronze¬†bust¬†of Hirschfeld, taken from the institute, was placed on top of the bonfire.¬†One estimate says that between 12,000 to 20,000 books and journals, and even larger number of images and sex subjects, were destroyed. Another estimate says that about 25,000 books were destroyed.

>On Transgender Day of Visibility, we celebrate the strength, joy, and absolute courage of some of the bravest people I know.

No one should have to be brave just to be themselves.

>Let me be clear: These attacks are un-American and must end. The bullying, discrimination, and political attacks that trans kids face have exacerbated our national mental health crisis. More than half of transgender youth say they have seriously considered suicide. Loving parents are terrified for their children‚Äôs futures. To help, my Administration is providing dedicated emergency mental health resources: If you‚Äôre a transgender young person who needs help, you can call 988 to reach the nationwide suicide prevention and crisis hotline. Press ‚Äú3‚Äù to speak with a counselor specifically trained to support LGBTQI+ youth.

>My Administration will never quit fighting to end discrimination, to stand against these unjust state laws, and to guarantee everyone the fundamental right and freedom to be who they are. We‚Äôll never stop working to create a world where everyone can live without fear; where parents, teachers, and whole communities come together to support kids, no matter how they identify; and every child is surrounded by compassion and love.

Former President Donald Trump is on his way to becoming a ‚Äúfour-time loser,‚Äù New Hampshire‚Äôs Republican governor argued on Sunday.

Chris Sununu told Meet the Press that Trump had blown winnable elections and badly hurt Republicans in 2018, 2020, and 2022, while arguing that Trump is more vulnerable in the GOP primary than it currently seems‚Äîand warning that he could hurt the GOP in 2024.

The New Hampshire governor has for months insisted that the Republican Party is ready to move on and won‚Äôt nominate Trump again. And Sununu made it clear that he still thinks Trump will be a disaster if he‚Äôs the party‚Äôs standard-bearer in the next election.

Polls bear this out: While President Biden‚Äôs poll numbers are in bad shape, recent surveys show him beating Trump nationally and in key swing states, even as he trails DeSantis.

Don't get excited because he's always tried to portray himself as a moderate but he's apart of the same grifting game as the rest of the GQP. 

He's currently selling our state out to the highest bidders while driving residents out and absolutely ignoring the will of his constituents in an effort to prioritize some wealthier friends who will support his run in 2024.

He's a douche and doesn't deserve the time of day that 45's degeneracy affords him.

>Readers might be surprised to learn that Mississippi has the highest child vaccination rate of any state in the country. The main reason is that it is one of a handful of states with a school vaccination requirement that has no exceptions of any kind. It formerly had a religious exception, but the state supreme court ruled that it violated the state constitution in 1979.


>This is why Mississippi has not had a measles outbreak since 1992.
>Alas, that vaccination crown is likely to be lost soon. Federal District Court Judge Halil Ozerden, a George W. Bush appointee, recently ruled that Mississippi must reintroduce a religious exemption.


>That ruling is part and parcel of the Republican turn against their own health. Many tens of thousands of loyal conservative voters have died unnecessarily of COVID-19 because they refused to get the vaccine‚Äîa refusal championed by anti-vaccine messaging from political leaders and media figures (many of whom died of COVID themselves). Now that has made them more skeptical of vaccines of any kind, which might just bring back measles, mumps, rubella, polio, and more. The GOP is so politically diseased that it can‚Äôt take elementary steps to protect its own members from actual disease.

‚Ä¶.

>Conservative resistance to vaccines comes from three interrelated factors. First is the sheer self-indulgent lunacy of the right-wing base. For years, this group has been marinating in a propaganda stew of inflammatory anti-immigrant racism, unhinged accusations about Democrats (they‚Äôre not citizens, they‚Äôre pedophiles, they‚Äôre in league with Satan), hysterical lies about crime in big cities, and sundry other conspiratorial nonsense that has given them leave to be mean to anyone they don‚Äôt like. Buttoned-down, sensible analysis about how vaccines work just doesn‚Äôt hit the rage buttons in the same way.

> Even if some religion were to forbid vaccination, children would still have a right to health no matter what their parents might believe, and more importantly, other children in school have a right not to be exposed to preventable deadly diseases.

> Conservative resistance to vaccines comes from three interrelated factors.

> That&#039;s why many conservatives first convinced themselves that hydroxychloroquine, and then ivermectin, were magic cures for COVID. Many conservatives are still giving the latter drug to their own kids despite a pro-ivermectin influencer recently dying of a common side effect of the drug.

Segregation first - remove access to health care, public spaces, educational facilities, etc.

Then eradication.

There's no real mystery here. It's all quite clear. And there are way too many of us who aren't getting that yet, for some reason. We're so desensitized, so jaded, and some of us so comfortable because we assume we are safe ourselves. 

Nobody is safe. And if *anyone* is unsafe then that should be enough for the rest of us to do whatever we can to stop it.

That comes out to somewhere between 1 in 17 and 1 in 7 unincarcerated men in America being rapists, with a cluster of studies showing about 1 in 8. 

The numbers can't really be explained away by small sizes, as sample sizes can be quite large, and statistical tests of proportionality show even the best case scenario, looking at the study that the authors acknowledge is an underestimate, the 99% confidence interval shows it's at least as bad as 1 in 20, which is nowhere near where most people think it is. People will go through all kinds of mental gymnastics to convince themselves it's not that bad, or it's not that bad *anymore* (in fact, [it's arguably getting worse](https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/cdc-sexual-attacks-teen-girls-increased-lockdown-rcna70782)). But the reality is, most of us know a rapist, we just don't always know who they are (and sometimes, [they don't even know](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquaintance_rape#Motivations), because [they're experts at rationalizing their own behavior](https://web.archive.org/web/20191102225207/https://sapac.umich.edu/article/196)).

> Trump is being taken to court by longtime Elle advice columnist E. Jean Carroll, who first accused Trump of raping her in a Bergdorf Goodman changing room in the mid-1990s in a 2019 essay for New York magazine.

> Carroll says their encounter started off playful, with Trump asking Carroll to help him pick out a gift for a female friend.

> Trump&#039;s lawyers asked to delay the trial a month so that they could probe Hoffman&#039;s involvement more, but that request was denied, though Kaplan allowed Trump&#039;s legal team to conduct another deposition with Carroll before the trial starts.

>  
>*Instead of permanently yanking the products from the market after the 2020 order, the EPA only required industry to add further application instructions to the herbicides‚Äô labels before reapproving the products.*  
>  
>*A late 2021 EPA investigation found the same problems persist even with new directions added to the label, but the agency still allows Monsanto, BASF and other producers to continue using dicamba.*

&#x200B;

>*The EPA‚Äôs move is another example of the agency ‚Äútreating the pesticide industry not as regulated companies, but as clients‚Äù, said Nathan Donley, environmental health science director with the Center For Biological Diversity.*  
>  
>*The EPA‚Äôs pesticide office is included in allegations that career managers are influenced by or have colluded with industry, and in some cases falsified science to make dangerous substances appear less toxic. About one-third of the pesticide office‚Äôs funding comes from industry fees.*  
>  
>*‚ÄúThe pesticide industry has a ton of clout in the EPA‚Äôs pesticide office, a ton of ability to persuade people there, and the culture at the office is very in alliance with the pesticide industry,‚Äù Donley told the Guardian.*

>*The EPA did not respond to a request for comment.*

>*The agency in 2016 approved the dicamba-based herbicide developed by Monsanto, which was to be used on genetically modified soybean and cotton crops that the company designed and are ‚Äúdicamba-tolerant‚Äù.*  
>  
>*The herbicides are sprayed over fields and efficiently kill weeds. However, they are also highly volatile and prone to drifting into neighboring fields when they are spread, or can lift off the ground and plants and travel up to a mile.*  
>  
>*When that happens, the herbicide can damage or kill neighboring crops and plants that are not engineered to be dicamba-resistant. Most frequently, the substance impairs their ability to grow or flower, and it reduces height and yield of non-dicamba-resistant crops.*  
>  
>*The results are ‚Äúdevastating‚Äù and destroying millions of acres as ‚Äúas never before seen in the history of US agriculture‚Äù, the plaintiffs said.*  
>  
>*The herbicide also impairs plants and flowers‚Äô ability to produce nectar, which environmental groups say deprives pollinators of food. In some cases, direct dicamba exposure can kill insects, mammals and other animals, Donley said, and it is linked to reproductive harm and developmental problems in animals.*

In the digital age where currency doesn't actually exist in a tangible way. It can and technically is infinite, and therefore, any scarcity is fabricated intentionally.


That's the simple form of the idea as far as I know of it. I am sure there is someone here much more versed in its specific than I am. But the idea of a cap/ceiling on something that is made up from the very beginning is kind of laughable. 

America controls and produces its own currency. The value of which can be set specifically so fluctuation or loss of value is also fabricated and intentional. There could be some level of reasoning when money was all physical. But at our level of technology.

I was going to go, but decided after this debacle I'm not going to grace Nashville or Tennessee and give them any business.

Hockey fans have either said, who cares? Or why punish Nashville? It's not about punishing Nashville, but the rich owners that donate to these clowns. The NHL could take a stance and say, you know what? No more. This is racism to a degree that we cannot agree with and we aren't going to give the media space, the money to a state that is so nakedly racist that we cannot ignore it. But no, they don't care.

This debt ceiling histrionics by the Republicans is complete bullshit and unnecessary.

The Republicans aren't fiscally responsible. After all Reagan tripled the national debt, Dubya doubled the national debt. The ex insurrectionist-in-chief added as much to the debt in 4 years as Obama added in 8 years.

2371,Chris Christie Believes He Can Take Down Trump. Does Anyone Else?,,"Here's the beginning of our story, including an exclusive interview with Chris Christie:  


If Chris Christie had a microphone to drop, he would have dropped it.  


‚ÄúI am the viable Trump alternative,‚Äù the former New Jersey governor and not-quite-yet 2024 GOP presidential candidate told The Daily Beast, swiveling on his heel and promptly ending the interview to go work the room at the Keene Country Club Friday night.  


That was his answer when asked if he‚Äôd thought at all about a repeat of his iconic 2016 exit from the Granite State, where he neutered Marco Rubio‚Äôs campaign in a viral debate takedown before finishing in sixth place, subsequently becoming the first 2016 candidate to endorse Donald Trump.  


Christie insisted he no longer holds the position that he would still vote for Donald Trump, were the former president to become the GOP nominee for the third consecutive cycle.  


But he also told a 15-year-old at a town hall in Henniker the night before that, given everything he now knows about Trump, he would still vote for Trump over Hillary Clinton in a hypothetical rematch. (He tried to clean up those comments Friday night to The Daily Beast, though his explanation still doesn‚Äôt quite make sense.)  


His best answer on the Trump question‚Äîtrying to appeal to anti-Trump Republicans while still not ostracizing Republicans‚Äîis that he simply wouldn‚Äôt vote if Trump were the GOP nominee, as he told The Atlantic last week.  


But the toughest question Christie has to answer is how, exactly, he could actually be the Republican nominee.  


After polling no higher than 3 percent in any of the surveys of the prospective 2024 field thus far, and after finishing in sixth place the last time he went toe-to-toe with Trump, Christie seems to be trying to answer that question himself before he officially jumps into the race. His heart seems to want him to run, but his head doesn‚Äôt sound settled.",8

2. His disqualification has to upheld through an appeals process that would no doubt reach SCOTUS, and be upheld by the 6:3 SCOTUS.

So many of us hate what's happening here. And those of us who were active with political volunteer organizing saw the writing on the wall, but were ignored.

>  
>More is coming.  
>  
>Republicans now surpass registered Democrats in the state by almost 455,000 voters, having taken the lead two years ago for the first time in modern Florida history. Like many states, a geographic sorting is confining more Democrats to urban areas and Republicans to sprawling suburban and rural communities.

>And while the governor almost equally divides Floridians when it comes to whether they have a favorable opinion of him, UNF had found DeSantis the choice of most registered Republicans in the state for the party‚Äôs presidential nomination, topping former President Donald Trump.  
>  
>But Democrats say the disconnect between the Legislature and many Floridians is clear when talking to voters about the difficulties of finding affordable property insurance, the sharp divide in schools over books and social issues, the state‚Äôs soaring shortage of teachers, and the high costs of housing.

It would cancel Democratic President Joe Biden's effort to cancel roughly $400 billion in student debt, which Republicans have portrayed as unfair to those who did not go to college or already paid off their debts. The Supreme Court is expected to rule before July whether that plan is legal.

REPEAL GREEN TAX INCENTIVES

It would repeal incentives for renewable energy, electric vehicles and other climate-friendly technology that Democrats passed last year as part of the Inflation Reduction Act. It does not target corporate tax increases, drug-pricing restraints or other aspects of that law.

TIGHTEN WORK REQUIREMENTS

The plan would stiffen work requirements for participants in some antipoverty programs.

Childless adults up to 56 who get health insurance through Medicaid, which covers low-income people, would have to work at least 80 hours a month or participate in job training or community service.

Likewise, childless adults up to 56 years old who receive food assistance through the SNAP program would lose benefits after three months if they could not prove they were working at least 20 hours a week or participating in a job training program. Those work requirements currently apply to those up to 50 years old.

INCREASED AUTHORITY OVER REGULATIONS

It would give Congress greater power to review new rules put forward by the executive branch.

MORE INCENTIVES FOR OIL AND GAS

McCarthy's package includes a sweeping fossil-fuel bill that passed the Republican-controlled House in March but has stalled in the Democratic-controlled Senate.

Impeachment will go absolutely nowhere, two thirds of congress won‚Äôt reverse it, and even the bastardized version of the supreme court wouldn‚Äôt rule against it. So the debt ceiling is not going to default.

The MAGA are not rational law makers. They are not working for the good of the country. Each one is a mini-Trump in their own right, bent on the show, the performance politics.  Burning down the economy is their season climax, the big one, the one where think they come out the winners, they get to hold up the WWE belt and claim victory.

It‚Äôs essentially to show up and vote. And if someone‚Äôs not doing that, there comes a time where ethically ‚Äî but not legally ‚Äî they owe their constituents an explanation for why,‚Äù *said Jeremy Faust, an emergency physician at Brigham and Women‚Äôs Hospital at Harvard Medical School and a public health expert.*  
>  
>*Fact is, age-related decline is very real. And it‚Äôs especially likely to be an issue for public officials who hold powerful roles. According to a 2018 report by The Pew Charitable Trusts,* [*the median retirement age is 62*](https://www.pewtrusts.org/-/media/assets/2018/11/whendoamericansplantoretire_final.pdf) *‚Äî but a senator is far different than the median American, and* [*the powerful usually want to remain in power*](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/01/opinion/sunday/inequality-america-paul-krugman.html)*.*  
>  
>*Without an easy way to figure out whether a member of Congress is up to their job, politicians will inevitably refuse to leave positions of power even if they seem past their prime. And more and more, the consequences could have serious ramifications.*   
>  
>*Right now, though, Feinstein‚Äôs absence is stopping Democrats from restocking the judiciary ‚Äî and that‚Äôs incredibly important today given the role that judges are playing in abortion rights, among a host of other issues.*  
>  
>*In most of these situations, it was easy to argue that the lawmakers in question were past both the age and condition at which most people retire. And that history alone might make Democrats even more eager to convince Feinstein to resign. What likely helps Feinstein, though, is that questioning someone‚Äôs competence is a* [*fraught subject*](https://www.thedailybeast.com/nancy-pelosi-suggests-calls-for-dianne-feinstein-to-resign-are-sexist) *for* [*women in particular*](https://www.axios.com/2023/04/19/republicans-women-sexism-feinstein-resignation)*, and that past efforts to push older people in power to retire have been broadly criticized. Take, for instance, the late Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. During her final years on the court, those who dared to speak so openly about her ailing health were labeled as* [*sexist*](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2013/12/ruth-bader-ginsburgs-retirement-stop-telling-the-supreme-court-justice-to-quit-so-obama-can-appoint-her-successor.html)*,* [*gross*](https://prospect.org/power/ruth-bader-ginsburg-retirement-value-term-limits/) *or simply having* [*bad manners*](https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2014/03/dont-tell-ruth-ginsburg-to-retire/284479/)*. (Of course, these arguments did not age well when Ginsburg‚Äôs death from cancer allowed a Republican presidency and Senate to fill her seat with a conservative.)*  
>  
>*So while Democratic leaders like Rep. Nancy Pelosi of California could be right that a male senator wouldn‚Äôt face similar calls to retire, the real problem is that the parties don‚Äôt have a way to deal with situations like this ‚Äî situations that will likely become more common.*",42

So go buy that Molson Coors beer.  You know the company that received a perfect score for 19 straight years from the Human Rights Campaign Foundation for their inclusivity with the LGBT community.  The yearly beer sponsor for Denver's PrideFest.  Significant financial investment in many LGBT organizations and charities.

Or perhaps Miller?  You know the company that has an entire community initiative called ""Open and Proud"" devoted to making bars open and safe spaces for the LGBT community nationwide.  I particularly enjoyed their campaign called ""Beers and Queers History"" during 2021 LGBT+ History month which was about how bars have played a crucial role in empowering the LGBT+ community to live authentically and freely.

Well if Bud Light, Budweiser, Coors Light and Miller Light are all out, bigots can always flock to the 5th most popular beer brand right?  Spend your money on Michelob Ultra!  Oh wait........they're owned by Anheuser-Busch too.  LOL

Maybe we go with Grupo Modelo (Constellation Brands) next which produces Corona, Corona Light, Modelo, and Dos Equis?  First this would be HILARIOUS to see them run to a Mexican beer given they hate Mexicans almost as much as LGBT people.  Can't get their fix of bigotry here either however.  This company is already partnered with Stonewall Sports which promotes LGBTQ+ participation.  Also another top performer in the Corporate Equality Index for LGBTQ equality.

Ron DeSantis endorsed Heineken the other day so they must be an option right?  Nope.  They're a yearly sponsor of NYC Pride.  Hell Neil Patrick Harris was their brand ambassador for a long time.  You may remember not long ago that it was Heineken that pulled out of the St. Patrick's Day parades in NYC and Boston due a ban on openly gay marchers.

&#x200B;

I could go on but why bother.  We've already covered most of the top 20 beers sold in America and most of the top 50 I didn't mention are owned by these companies too.  You really have to dig deep in the bottom of the barrel to find a beer company that hasn't supported the LBGT community.",10

This marks the fourth year in a row that the country's leading brewer and its charitable foundation have supported this initiative.

‚ÄúAnheuser-Busch's continued investment in the Rice Stewardship Partnership will provide opportunities to support U.S. rice farmers and their growing operations, as well as allow them to test new technology to improve their operations and meet sustainability goals. Investments like these are what sustain U.S. rice farmers and provide the opportunities to test new agriculture practices and we are very grateful for our strong partnership with Anheuser-Busch,‚Äù said Betsy Ward, President and CEO of USA Rice.

‚ÄúArkansas is proud of our role as the nation's leading rice producer,‚Äù said United States Senator John Boozman (R-AR). ‚ÄúThis investment will support continued research and development of innovative techniques and practices to improve production, conservation and sustainability measures. Mutually beneficial partnerships like this that promote solutions for farmers, businesses and outdoor enthusiasts help us meet the changing needs of the industry and evolving challenges to creating a safe and abundant crop.‚Äù

As the largest end user of rice in the country, Anheuser-Busch sources all of its rice from American farmers, totaling more than $120 million of rice and nearly 20 million bushels last year alone. Rice helps provide the clean, crisp taste that has been a Budweiser trademark since its creation in 1876 and remains a prized ingredient in Budweiser, Bud Light and Michelob Ultra, among others.",1

3482,Ron DeSantis' culture war is turning Republicans off,,"What fascists like is not culture war, or some principled stance against specific things . What fascists like is winning and bullying. They crave the feeling of strength that comes from imposing your will on a weaker group. Everything else is just convenient justification to fill their primal lust for power. Once you understand this, you will see their position is very consistent. 

DeSantis' culture war is exactly the right wing want. That is why his was so popular when he started his stuns. Trafficking undocumented workers, book bans, don't say gay bills, republicans loved that shit because it was bullying already very weak groups within society. It was so popular, all the red states started following him. 

But DeSantis then decided to take on Disney for exactly the same thing, but Disney is strong. Disney rather stay silent on politics, but when push come to shove, they know which side of the culture war has the money. So when Disney's army of lawyers easily fends off DeSantis' feeble attempts to control them, it exposes how weak the fascists movement actually are. That feeling of weakness is antithetical to the fascist movement. 

Fascists will never admit that their positions are unpopular, and also not economically strong enough to sway Disney. So if it can't be the movement that is weak, it must be DeSantis that is weak. He is the most convenient scapegoat. It must have been his weakness of character that made them take this L against Disney, and cutting him off is the easiest way to restore the feeling of strength. 

TLDR: They love culture war, cause it is just a way to bully minority groups, because it makes them feel strong. DeSantis pick a target that can fight back, and that makes them feel weak. They blame DeSantis for making them feel weak, and ditching him is the quickest way to feel strong again.

I‚Äôm from the Midwest and I‚Äôm seeing it happen. Trump flags have almost disappeared completely when they were proudly displayed with arrogant signage for years after he lost the election.
